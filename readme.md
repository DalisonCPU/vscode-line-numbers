# Vscode-line-numbers

This addon makes it easy to report what line you are at in vscode. You can also check what character in the line you are at, (vscode users might know it as columns). There is not a lot to explain, just some keyboard shortcuts from within visual studio code:

* NVDA+SHIFT+W: report the column (the number of the character in the line).
* NVDA+W: report your line number.

That's all for now. If you have any questions, Please feel free to contact me at ashleygrobler04@gmail.com

Thanks for using this!
